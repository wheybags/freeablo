# LuaBridge 2.5

[LuaBridge][1] is a lightweight and dependency-free library for mapping data,
functions, and classes back and forth between C++ and [Lua][2] (a powerful,
fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language) . LuaBridge has been tested
and works with Lua revisions starting from 5.1.5., although it should work in
any version of Lua from 5.1.0 as well as [LuaJit][3].

LuaBridge offers the following features:

- [MIT Licensed][4]
- A printable [Reference Manual][5].
- Headers-only: No Makefile, no .cpp files, just one #include!
- Simple, light, and nothing else needed (like Boost).
- No macros, settings, or configuration scripts needed.
- Supports different object lifetime management models.
- Convenient, type-safe access to the Lua stack.
- Automatic function parameter type binding.
- Easy access to Lua objects like tables and functions.
- Written in a clear and easy to debug style.
- Does not require C++11.

Please read the [LuaBridge Reference Manual][5] for more details on the API.

## Unit Tests

Unit test build requires a CMake and C++11 compliant compiler.

There are 4 unit test flavors:
* `Tests51` - uses Lua 5.1, with C++11 features
* `Tests51L` - uses Lua 5.1, no C++11 features
* `Tests52` - uses Lua 5.2, with C++11 features
* `Tests52L` - uses Lua 5.2, no C++11 features

Build using Make on Linux/MacOS:
```bash
clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:vinniefalco/LuaBridge.git
cd LuaBridge
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B build
# or cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -B build
# or cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build
cd build
make -j
```

Generate XCode project on MacOS:
```bash
clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:vinniefalco/LuaBridge.git
cd LuaBridge
cmake -G Xcode -B build
# Generates XCode project build/LuaBridge.xcodeproj
```

Generate MSVS solution on Windows:
```cmd
clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:vinniefalco/LuaBridge.git
cd LuaBridge
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -B build
# or cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -B build
# or cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -B build
# or cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -B build
# or cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2019" -A Win64 -B build
# or cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2019" -B build
# Generates MSVS solution build/LuaBridge.sln
```

# LuaBridge Demo

LuaBridge provides both a command line program and a stand-alone graphical
program for compiling and running the test suite. The graphical program brings
up an interactive window where you can enter execute Lua statements in a
persistent environment. This application is cross platform and works on
Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and GNU/Linux systems with X11. The stand-alone
program should work anywhere. Both of these applications include LuaBridge,
Lua version 5.2, and the code necessary to produce a cross platform graphic
application. They are all together in a separate repository, with no
additional dependencies, available on Github at [LuaBridge Demo and Tests][6].
This is what the GUI application looks like, along with the C++ code snippet
for registering the two classes:
