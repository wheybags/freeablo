 Important Note!!
 ================

The purpose of this folder is to contain files that are auto-generated by the Introjucer,
and ALL files in this folder will be mercilessly DELETED and completely re-written whenever
the Introjucer saves your project.

Therefore, it's a bad idea to make any manual changes to the files in here, or to
put any of your own files in here if you don't want to lose them. (Of course you may choose
to add the folder's contents to your version-control system so that you can re-merge your own
modifications after the Introjucer has saved its changes).
